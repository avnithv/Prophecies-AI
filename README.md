# Prophecies-AI

An AI for Prophecies by Andy Juell. Here is a [description](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/game-12-prophecies-1.pdf) of it in Math Games with Bad Drawings by Ben Orlin.

Currently the program is a  550 line file with a GUI using tkinter. The highest level AI uses the [MTD(f)](https://people.csail.mit.edu/plaat/mtdf.html) algorithm. 

In order to play, all you need to do is run the python file with tkinter installed. Tkinter may not work properly on a Mac OS.
